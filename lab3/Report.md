## Databases Laboratory Work Nr.3

## Database Creation and Manipulation. DML

### Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft SQL Server 2012
  - Oracle 11g/12c

### Objectives:
  - T-SQL and Oracle data types and build-in functions
  - Constraints
  - Creation, rename and update table
  - SQL Server Data Types and Functions
  
  
### Tasks :

1.  Which of the numbers below may be in a DECIMAL(4,1) field type?
 
         a) 16,2   b)116,2   c)16,21   d)1116,2   e)1116,21
         
         
 2. [Col1] from the table is the INT type , and [Col2] is of DECIMAL(2,1).
 
    * What type should be the [Col3] in order to save the result of the expression [Col1] * [Col2]?
    [Col3]

 3. Create a university database with default properties. In this database create 2 tables (grupe, discipline), the schemes of which are defined in section 3.3 of the chapter.
 
 4. Include the tables in the respective tables of the university database:
   
     
     
 ### Implementation
 
 1. b)116,2 
 2. DECIMAL(2,1) 
 
 3. Here I create the database and tables (right click in database, add database, right click "universitatea/tables", add new table)

 4. Click data on table/Edit first 200 rows

 
 ### Conclusion
 During this laboratory work I learned how to create tables for a database and how to design them.
  Also I learned the types that can be the fields of a database and also how to edit a specific table
